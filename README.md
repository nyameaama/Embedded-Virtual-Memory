# Embedded-Virtual-Memory

The Embedded Virtual Memory library is a library which provides a Virtual Memory Implementation for Memory Constrained Controllers. As a way to preserve RAM, the memory management technique provides an idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on the controller which allows for a very large (main) memory.
